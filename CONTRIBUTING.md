# Contributing Guide

This project is a community effort, and everyone is welcome to contribute !

If you are interested in contributing to PyTorch-Ignite's examples, there are many ways to help out. Your contributions may fall into the following categories:

1. It helps us very much if you could report issues youâ€™re facing with:

   - Executing the Juypter notebooks, scripts or rendering assets.
   - Understanding the language written in any of the notebooks that can be simplified.

2. You would like to add more examples. These fall into two categories:
   1. Tutorials: Something general which has emphasis on explanation and self-contained end-to-end code which showcases an ignite concept/concepts. these are meant for learning purposes when exploring the library. See cifar10 tutorial on distributed training: https://pytorch-ignite.ai/tutorials/cifar10-distributed/
   2. How-to guides: These are very specific and more code-based. used to answer a specific question like how to use fastailr finder in ignite or how to do cross validation. comparing it with the cifar10 tutorial above, if we were to make a how to guide it could go like: how to train a model using multiple gpus with ignite.
